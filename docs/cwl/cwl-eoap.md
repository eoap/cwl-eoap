In the scope of this Best Practice, the Application Package uses:

- the CWL _Workflow_ Description specification as encoding to describe the Application, its parameters and data flows
- the CWL _CommandLineTool_ for describing the command-line tools used, their arguments and their invocation within containers.

With the use of CWL Workflow Description Standard as encoding, the Application can also possibly yield several Application Packages that expose parameters and inputs in different flavors and execution patterns.
